# Installing Gate

The installation of Gate is ultra easy! You only need to download the executable binary file,
and you're ready to run the proxy! The configuration file `config.yml` is optional, see
[Configuration](configuration) for more.

## Method 1 - Download the pre-built binary

You can download the latest pre-built binary for your operating system from the [release page](https://github.com/minekube/gate/releases).

<ButtonGroup>
    <Button type="primary" href="https://github.com/minekube/gate/releases" target="_blank">View Downloads</Button>
</ButtonGroup>

| OS      | Binary Name with Processor                        |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `windows_arm64`, `windows_amd64` or `windows_386` |
| MacOS   | `darwin_amd64` or `darwin_arm64`                  |
| Linux   | `linux_arm64`, `linux_amd64` or `linux_386`       |

Make sure the binary file has execution permissions, if not already:
```shell
$ chmod +x gate
```

After you have downloaded the binary you can open your terminal
where the binary resides (e.g. `Downloads` folder) and try to run it:
```sh
$ ./gate -h
```

Optionally you can move the Gate binary to somewhere like `/usr/local/bin`
or add the binary path to your `PATH` environment variable.


## Method 2 - Install using Go

Since [`Gate`](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/master/go.mod) is a Go module you can easily install the latest release.
To run the following command ensure you have [`Go`](https://go.dev/doc/install), and [`Git`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) installed.

```sh
$ go install go.minekube.com/gate@latest
```

After this step you can run Gate easily from anywhere in your terminal:
```sh
$ gate -h
```

## Method 3 - Run Gate directly from the Internet

Using Go you could even run Gate without the installation command.
Internally Go downloads and caches the module, builds and caches it and finally runs it,
all at once.
```sh
$ go run go.minekube.com/gate@latest
```

Thanks to local caching running this command a second time would start Gate even quicker.
