## About Connect

Minekube Connect allows you to connect **any** Minecraft server or proxy,
whether online or offline mode, public or hidden behind your home network or anywhere else in the world,
with the open Connect network that is optimized for high availability and ensures low latency
by connecting you to thousands of edge proxies nearest to you.

More documentation, diagrams and tutorials are following as soon as the Connect services launch, stay tuned in our [Discord](https://minekube.com/discord)!
